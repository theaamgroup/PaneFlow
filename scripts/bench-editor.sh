# The benchmark is the ignored test `editor_pipeline_benchmark` in

# a comparison when the baseline exists, the plain results otherwise. See

Usage: scripts/bench-editor.sh [--set-baseline] [--help]

Runs the paneflow-editor-bench suite under the release profile and writes
bench/results/editor-<stamp>-<sha>.json, then prints a Markdown table between
the PANEFLOW_BENCH_TABLE_BEGIN and PANEFLOW_BENCH_TABLE_END markers.

Options:
  --set-baseline  Copy the fresh result over bench/editor-baseline.json. Refused
                  when the run reports a cpu_share below 0.90, because a
                  contended run inflates every timing it would freeze.
  --help          Print this message and exit.

Environment:
  PANEFLOW_BENCH_OUT         Result file the suite writes. Set by this script.
  PANEFLOW_BENCH_BASELINE    Baseline the table compares against. Set by this
                             script when bench/editor-baseline.json exists;
                             without it the table drops its comparison columns.
  PANEFLOW_BENCH_SHA         Short commit the result records. Set by this script.
  PANEFLOW_BENCH_DIRTY       Whether the tracked worktree is dirty.
  PANEFLOW_BENCH_STAMP       UTC stamp the result records.
  PANEFLOW_BENCH_ALLOW_DEBUG Allow a debug-profile run, which the suite refuses.
  PANEFLOW_BENCH_SKIP_SHAPE  Skip the platform shaping probe.
