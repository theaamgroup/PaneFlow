#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Sign a PaneFlow .app bundle with the Apple Developer ID certificate.
#
# US-015 / US-023. Run this on a macOS runner AFTER `scripts/bundle-macos.sh`
# has produced `dist/PaneFlow.app`, and BEFORE `scripts/notarize-macos.sh`.
#
# The build keychain is intentionally ephemeral: created with a random
# password at the start of this script and deleted in the EXIT trap. Nothing
# is persisted across CI runs, so a compromised runner image cannot replay
# the signing certificate later.
#
# Required env vars (sourced from GitHub Secrets in release.yml):
#   APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERT_P12        base64-encoded .p12 file
#   APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERT_PASSWORD   password to decrypt the .p12
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID                   10-char team ID (for sanity checks)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sign-macos.sh                      # signs dist/PaneFlow.app with release entitlements
#   scripts/sign-macos.sh path/to/MyApp.app
#   scripts/sign-macos.sh --entitlements packaging/macos/paneflow.dev.entitlements
#   scripts/sign-macos.sh --entitlements packaging/macos/paneflow.nightly.entitlements path/to/MyApp.app
#
# Arguments:
#   --entitlements <path>    Entitlements plist to embed at signing time.
#                            Defaults to packaging/macos/paneflow.entitlements
#                            (see US-023 for the three supported variants:
#                            release, dev, nightly).

# --- Sign (inside-out, US-023) -------------------------------------------
# Apple Technote TN3127 and the cmux reference script
# (cmux/scripts/sign-cmux-bundle.sh) both prescribe inside-out signing for
# any bundle that may grow nested binaries: every helper / framework / dylib
# inside Contents/Frameworks/, Contents/Helpers/, Contents/PlugIns/ must be
# signed BEFORE the parent .app. Signing the parent first either re-signs
# the children with the wrong entitlements (--deep) or leaves them unsigned
# (which notarytool then rejects with "The binary is not signed").
#
# bundle-macos.sh today produces a flat bundle (Contents/MacOS/paneflow +
# Contents/Resources/PaneFlow.icns), so the find loops below match nothing
# and exit immediately. Kept in place so that when PaneFlow grows a helper
# bundle (LSP sidecar, MCP host, ...), no signing-script change is required.
#
# Flags:
#   --force        replace any prior signature (idempotent re-signs).
#   --options runtime
#                  enable hardened runtime - required for notarization.
#   --timestamp    embed an Apple-supplied RFC3161 timestamp - required
#                  for notarization. Without --timestamp, notarytool rejects
#                  with "The signature does not include a secure timestamp."
#   --entitlements bind the entitlements plist to the signature so
#                  Gatekeeper enforces them at launch.
#
# --deep is INTENTIONALLY OMITTED on the parent sign call (Apple TN3127):
# the inside-out walk above already covers the children with their own,
# correct entitlements. --deep is still used on --verify below, where it
# is the right flag for recursive signature traversal.
