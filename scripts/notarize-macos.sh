# Notarize + staple a signed PaneFlow .app bundle.
#
# US-015. Run this on a macOS runner AFTER `scripts/sign-macos.sh` has
# stamped a Developer ID signature on `dist/PaneFlow.app`. After this
# script succeeds, the bundle is ready for `.dmg` assembly (US-016).
#
# Required env vars (sourced from GitHub Secrets in release.yml):
#   APPLE_ID                        developer account email
#   APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD     app-specific password (NOT the Apple ID
#                                   password - generate at
#                                   appleid.apple.com > App-Specific Passwords)
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID                   10-char team ID
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/notarize-macos.sh                      # notarizes dist/PaneFlow.app
#   scripts/notarize-macos.sh path/to/MyApp.app

# --- Build the submission archive ----------------------------------------
# `ditto -c -k --keepParent` is Apple's canonical way to archive an .app
# for notarytool. Plain `zip(1)` strips resource forks and extended
# attributes that codesign wrote during signing; submitting a `zip` archive
# instead of a `ditto` archive can yield "The binary is not signed"
# notarization rejections even on a properly signed bundle.
ditto -c -k --keepParent "$APP" "$ZIP"

# --- Submit (non-blocking) -----------------------------------------------
# Originally this script used `notarytool submit --wait`, which blocks the
# CI runner inside a single API call until Apple returns a terminal status.
# `--wait` produces no output during the wait - when Apple's notary backend
# is in a deep queue (observed 30+ min for first-time submissions from a
# new Developer account), the runner appears frozen with no heartbeat in
# the CI log, no submission ID exposed for out-of-band recovery, and no
# upper bound on duration short of the GitHub-default 6h job timeout.
#
# The replacement pattern submits without `--wait`, captures the
# submission ID immediately, and polls `notarytool info` on a fixed
# interval. This buys three things the `--wait` path could not:
#   - Heartbeat: each poll prints `[+MM:SS] In Progress...` to the CI log
#     so reviewers can see Apple is still processing rather than guessing
#     whether the runner deadlocked.
#   - Recoverability: the submission ID is logged at line 1 after submit,
#     so even if the runner is killed mid-poll the ID survives in the CI
#     transcript. A maintainer with any Mac + the same credentials can
#     run `xcrun notarytool info <id>` later to pick up where we left off.
#   - Bounded waits: a 90-min ceiling matches Apple's documented P99
#     (~30 min) plus first-submission scrutiny margin (typically 45-60
#     min) without consuming a 6h runner reservation when Apple stalls.
#
# `--output-format json` keeps parsing deterministic - the human-readable
# default text shifts between Xcode releases.

# --- Poll for terminal status --------------------------------------------
# Loop runs until status reaches Accepted / Invalid / Rejected, or the
# elapsed wait exceeds MAX_WAIT_SECONDS. POLL_INTERVAL=30s gives reviewers
# a heartbeat every half-minute without making the API call rate
# meaningfully expensive (Apple does not document a per-account rate
# limit on notarytool, but ~10 polls in the typical 5 min case and ~180
# polls at the 90 min ceiling are well below any plausible threshold).
#
# `set -e` aborts on a failing command substitution, so a non-zero
# `notarytool info` (network blip, transient 5xx) never reaches the case
# arm below. An unparseable body fails the same way inside python.
# Neither is terminal: log it, sleep POLL_INTERVAL, and poll again until
# a real status or MAX_WAIT_SECONDS.
