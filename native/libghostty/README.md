# libghostty-vt native input

`manifest.toml` is the single source of truth for Paneflow's native
libghostty-vt inputs. Cargo never fetches Ghostty, runs bindgen, invokes Zig,
or mutates an artifact. Reviewed archives live under `prebuilt/<rust-target>/`,
so a standard checkout only verifies and links repository content.

The pinned source is Ghostty
`f2d5758f6305867dc36b36293c6165d8152b853e` built with Zig 0.16.0 in
`ReleaseFast`. `bindings.rs` is pregenerated from the pinned C header. Its
normalized UTF-8 checksum is verified both in the workspace and in every
prepared artifact. Regenerate bindings only from that exact header, then
update `bindings_sha256` and every reviewed target.

## Linux archives

Prepare both reviewed Linux targets from a clean pinned checkout:

```sh
PANEFLOW_GHOSTTY_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/ghostty scripts/build-libghostty-linux.sh
```

Outputs are written below `target/libghostty/<rust-target>/`. Cargo uses one
only when `PANEFLOW_LIBGHOSTTY_DIR` explicitly selects it; otherwise it uses
the repository artifact. `--verify-reproducible` builds from two clean Zig
caches and compares the normalized archive, header, bindings, and build info.
Zig cache paths are removed from ELF debug data with `eu-strip`, then members
are repacked with deterministic `ar` mode.

## macOS arm64 archive

The reviewed Apple Silicon input is `prebuilt/aarch64-apple-darwin/`. It is
cross-built from a Linux host, because Ghostty only takes the Apple `libtool`
combine path when the build host is Darwin; a Linux host keeps the same
`zig ar -M` combine the Linux targets already normalize.

```sh
rustup component add llvm-tools
PANEFLOW_GHOSTTY_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/ghostty \
  scripts/build-libghostty-macos.sh --verify-reproducible
```

Normalization tools come from the `llvm-tools` component of the repository's
own pinned Rust toolchain, so `macos_llvm_version` moves only when that
toolchain moves. `PANEFLOW_LLVM_BIN` overrides that search.

Debug sections embed absolute paths, and `llvm-strip -S` drops them without
renumbering the addresses that followed, so path *length* leaks into the
stripped object. The recipe therefore pins every path that reaches debug info:
the pinned tree is exported to `macos_canonical_source_path`, the Zig
executable and `lib/` tree are staged at `macos_canonical_zig_path` and invoked
through `--zig-lib-dir`, and the Zig cache and install prefix are nested under
the canonical source root. Both staged roots are removed on success and on
failure. `--seed 0 -j1` pins Zig's build order, `llvm-strip -S` strips each
member, and `llvm-ar crsD --format=darwin` repacks them in `LC_ALL=C` basename
order.

The produced archive hash is compared against the manifest's `archive_sha256`
before the bundle is written; a mismatch aborts the build.
`--allow-hash-drift` downgrades it to a warning and exists only to mint a new
reviewed archive after a deliberate recipe change. Full rationale and the
reproducibility findings are in
[docs/release/macos-libghostty.md](../../docs/release/macos-libghostty.md).

## Windows x64 MSVC archive

The production Windows input is the SIMD-enabled static archive
`prebuilt/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/lib/ghostty-vt-static.lib`. Rebuild it from a
clean pinned checkout in an x64 Visual Studio environment:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-libghostty-windows.ps1 `
  -SourceDir C:\path\to\ghostty `
  -Zig C:\path\to\zig-0.16.0\zig.exe `
  -ZigSourceArchive C:\path\to\zig-0.16.0.tar.xz `
  -VerifyReproducible
```

The reviewed recipe requires:

| Input | Pinned value |
|---|---|
| Rust target | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| Zig target | `x86_64-windows-msvc` |
| Zig | `0.16.0` |
| Zig distribution | official x64 Windows ZIP, SHA-256 `68659eb5f1e4eb1437a722f1dd889c5a322c9954607f5edcf337bc3684a75a7e` |
| Zig executable SHA-256 | `086ce9d47ba42f33a514e1a6e04eb1d4a8fa1d75e0868e0213caad447c91e864` |
| Zig source library | official source archive, SHA-256 `43186959edc87d5c7a1be7b7d2a25efffd22ce5807c7af99067f86f99641bfdf` |
| Zig codegen image base | `0x0000000140000000` |
| Zig PE DLL characteristics | `0x8160` |
| MSVC toolset | `14.38.33130` |
| Windows SDK | `10.0.26100.0` |
| Visual Studio LLVM tools | `19.1.5` |
| Optimization | `ReleaseFast` |
| SIMD | `true` |
| Build seed and jobs | `--seed 0 -j1` |

The upstream preparation command is:

```text
zig.exe build --zig-lib-dir <official-source-lib> --verbose --seed 0 -j1 -Demit-lib-vt=true -Dtarget=x86_64-windows-msvc -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -Dsimd=true --prefix <fixed-prefix>
```

The CI downloads the manifest-pinned official Zig ZIP and source archive, then
verifies both archives, the executable, and its PE metadata. The source archive
provides the complete Zig library used by `--zig-lib-dir`; the Windows ZIP omits
library test files that Zig 0.16.0 analyzes after the formatter is split into
out-of-line helpers.

Clean upstream builds of `f2d5758f` are not reproducible on Windows with
`--seed 0 -j1` alone. The drift is confined to the generated
`ghostty-vt-static_zcu.obj` code for `PageFormatter.formatWithState`. The pinned
`windows-formatter-determinism.patch` splits the large formatter into explicit
out-of-line helpers before the build, and its path, input hash, output hash, and
own hash are part of the manifest and `build-info.txt` contract. Qualification
of this pin used six consecutive clean builds, which produced the same
normalized archive SHA-256,
`ad12e1177fc6bac1c39bd915baada04adccb7b24834838a26ae86b9f9357af1e`.
The build script requires two complete clean builds per invocation. CI runs
three independent passes, preserves all three comparisons as evidence, and
aborts before publication on any byte difference.

The export is built at fixed source, cache, and prefix paths. Ghostty asks Zig
to link ntdll and kernel32 into the static library, and a static Zig link
resolves a system library by archiving the SDK's whole import library, so
normalization drops those two members first: they are import libraries rather
than COFF objects, and both the Rust consumer and the MSVC smoke already link
them from `system_libraries`. LLVM then strips debug data from every remaining
member of Ghostty's emitted fat archive, zeros each COFF timestamp, and repacks
ordinally sorted members with deterministic `llvm-ar rcD` mode. It deliberately
does not replay the emitted `build-lib` command.
Header and symbol inventories use the same ordinal, case-sensitive ordering,
so hashes do not depend on the Windows locale. Two complete builds start from
empty caches at the same canonical paths and must match byte for byte before
publication. The fixed `C:\Users\Public\paneflow-libghostty-f2d5758f` source
path is part of the hash contract; the build aborts if that path is unavailable
or already occupied.

The fat archive contains Ghostty's Zig objects, Zig `compiler_rt`, simdutf,
Highway, and wuffs. Under Zig 0.15.2 its C and C++ members carried a `.drectve`
recording `RuntimeLibrary=MT_StaticRelease` and `/DEFAULTLIB:libcpmt.lib`;
under 0.16.0 no member declares a linker directive at all, so the static CRT
model is proved on the smoke executable instead: linking the archive with
`cl /MT` must yield an import table with no `vcruntime`, `ucrtbase`, `msvcp`,
or `api-ms-win-crt-` entry. Consumers link `ntdll.lib` and `kernel32.lib`.
There is no `ghostty-vt.dll`; C consumers of the static header must define
`GHOSTTY_STATIC`.

`windows-smoke.c` is the minimal MSVC reproducer. The build script compiles it
with `/MT /W4 /WX`, initializes a terminal, parses a deterministic VT fixture,
and releases the terminal through Ghostty. It also verifies x64 COFF headers,
the required C symbol inventory, and the executable's DLL dependencies used to
prove the static CRT model. A missing SIMD object, unresolved system symbol, wrong
architecture, hash drift, or dynamic Ghostty dependency aborts the build and
preserves the temporary evidence directory.

The prepared Windows directory includes the archive, installed headers,
normalized bindings, `headers.sha256`, `symbols.txt`, and `build-info.txt`.
Each top-level input is pinned by `manifest.toml`; the header index covers all
installed headers after deterministic line-ending, trailing-space, and comment
punctuation normalization. Publication replaces the complete previous target
tree by an atomic same-volume rename, so stale DLLs or metadata cannot survive
a rebuild. `paneflow-libghostty-sys/build.rs` selects this directory only for
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, requires its exact file inventory, rejects incomplete
or incoherent metadata with an actionable rebuild command, and emits only
static plus reviewed system link directives.

## ABI and licensing

`paneflow-libghostty-sys` is the only raw ABI surface. The safe wrapper owns
every native handle, copies borrowed callback data before returning, releases
Ghostty allocations through their matching Ghostty destructor, catches Rust
panics inside callbacks, and validates API version, discriminants, callback
signatures, sizes, alignments, and field offsets before constructing a
terminal.

The manifest records the archive-member license inventory and pins
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Packaging must reject an artifact whose reviewed
notice is absent, truncated, or stale.
