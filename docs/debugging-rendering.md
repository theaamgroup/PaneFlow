# Debugging terminal rendering

PaneFlow ships two complementary debug-only probes for the terminal renderer.
Both are gated `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` and compile to no-ops in release
builds, so they cost nothing to leave in the source tree.

Rendering goes through GPUI's Metal backend, the only backend this fork builds
against, so every coordinate the probes log is a Metal-path coordinate. A
fractional value here is a geometry bug in our own layout math, not a driver
difference: there is no second backend to compare against or blame.

## `PANEFLOW_LATENCY_PROBE=1` - keystroke-to-pixel timing

Captures per-phase latency from `KeyDownEvent` through `paint()` to the next
display refresh. Useful when investigating perceived input lag. Wired in
`src-app/src/terminal/view.rs`.

## `PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE=1` - cell / glyph coordinate logging

Captures the raw coordinates the terminal renderer hands to GPUI. Use it when
investigating visual artifacts (gaps between cells, glyph misalignment, block
character rendering). Defined in
`src-app/src/terminal/element/pixel_probe.rs`.

### Activate

```sh
PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE=1 RUST_LOG=paneflow::pixel_probe=debug cargo run
```

`PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE` is read once at first probe call and cached in a
`OnceLock`, so flipping it mid-session has no effect. Restart the binary.

### Output format

Each record is one `log::debug!` line on the `paneflow::pixel_probe` target.
Numeric fields are formatted as `<value>|frac=<+0.000000>` so a fractional
residual is visible at a glance.

| Record | Fields |
|---|---|
| `cell_dims` | `cell_width_raw`, `cell_width_snapped`, `line_height_raw`, `line_height_snapped`, `scale_factor` |
| `origin` | `x`, `y` |
| `glyph` | `line`, `col`, `x`, `y` (one per text run, sampled to first 16 columns of each row) |
| `bg` | `col`, `line`, `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` (one per cell background, same row sampling) |
| `block_quad` | `col`, `line`, `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` (block elements `▀ ▄ █` etc.) |

Row sampling caps log volume on wide terminals while keeping the visually
interesting left edge fully covered - gaps and alignment artifacts almost
always surface there first.

### Example session

The canonical repro is the Claude Code banner gap: a TUI that draws its border
out of block characters shows hairline gaps between cells, because a fractional
cell width reached the paint path. To capture it:

```sh
PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE=1 RUST_LOG=paneflow::pixel_probe=debug cargo run 2> probe.log
# In the spawned terminal, run a TUI that renders block characters.
claude
# Quit Paneflow, inspect probe.log:
grep cell_dims probe.log | head -3
grep block_quad probe.log | head -10
```

Look for fractional residuals: `frac=+0.400000` means an 8.4-px value reached
this site, which is the proximate cause US-002 / US-003 / US-004 are designed
to eliminate.

## `PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE_OVERLAY=1` - visual cell-bounds overlay

Independent of `PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE`. Draws a 1-px red border (alpha 0.3) on
every cell in every visible terminal pane, painted after the text pass so the
borders sit above glyphs.

```sh
PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE_OVERLAY=1 cargo run
```

Activate alone for a purely-visual sanity check, or combine with
`PANEFLOW_PIXEL_PROBE=1` to correlate the on-screen grid with the logged
coordinates.

## Asserting alignment in tests

`pixel_probe::assert_pixel_aligned(value, label)` panics when `value.fract()`
exceeds `1e-6`. US-003 / US-004 use it to fail loudly on fractional regressions
in the snapped paint paths.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
use crate::terminal::element::pixel_probe::assert_pixel_aligned;

assert_pixel_aligned(glyph_x.as_f32(), "glyph_x after US-003 snap");
```

## Release builds

The whole `pixel_probe` module is gated `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` at its
declaration in `src-app/src/terminal/element/mod.rs`. The call sites
(`resolve_frame_metrics`, `paint`, `paint_text_runs`, `paint_cell_backgrounds`,
`paint_block_quads`) are likewise gated, and the overlay paint pass is
both `cfg`-gated and behind a runtime check on `overlay_enabled()`. A
release build links nothing from this module.
