//! `DiffView` - GPUI entity hosting the multi-worktree diff viewer.
//!
//! Pipeline: each sibling worktree becomes a column whose diff
//! (`merge-base..working-tree`) is computed off the main thread
//! (`smol::unblock`) and applied back via `this.update` from a spawned task -
//! never mutated inside `render`. A per-view `generation` counter discards
//! stale results when a refresh is superseded (US-007 last-write-wins).
//!
//! EP-004: N columns render side by side in one tab (US-012) with a shared
//! base-branch selector (US-013), per-column hide/show (US-014), and live
//! refresh on working-tree / HEAD / index / base-ref changes via an
//! entity-owned `notify` watcher (US-015). Rendering is virtualized by the
//! custom `DiffElement` in both unified and split modes (US-006/US-009).
