//! Pane - a mono-surface leaf holding exactly one view (a terminal, a markdown
//! viewer, or a diff view).
//!
//! Each leaf in the layout tree holds an `Entity<Pane>`, and each pane holds a
//! single [`PaneSurface`]. Multiplicity lives one level up: a workspace owns a
//! list of tabs and each tab owns a layout of panes (PRD
//! `prd-cli-tab-hierarchy-2026-Q3`, EP-001/EP-002). A pane therefore has no tab
//! strip, no selection cursor and no cross-pane tab gesture - a second surface
//! is reached by splitting the pane or by opening another workspace tab.
//!
//! Communication with the parent (layout tree owner) uses the Zed pattern:
//! Pane emits `PaneEvent` via `cx.emit()`, parent subscribes via `cx.subscribe()`.
//!
//! The pane header (surface name, agent pill, action cluster) replaces the
//! former tab strip and paints nothing of its own: the floating card behind it
//! owns the fill (commit `30e26c5`).
