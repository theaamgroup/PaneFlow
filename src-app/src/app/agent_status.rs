//! Hook-free agent-state sources, and the one place they are applied.
//!
//! `agent_sessions` used to have a single writer: the `ai.*` lifecycle frames
//! in [`ipc_handler`](super::ipc_handler). That works right up until the hooks
//! do not run - an organization can disable them wholesale from Claude Code's
//! managed settings (`disableAllHooks`, which takes `statusLine` down with it,
//! or `allowManagedHooksOnly`, which drops Paneflow's entries without a word).
//! The sidebar then knows an agent is running and nothing else.
//!
//! Two sources fill that in, and both were already reaching Paneflow with
//! nobody listening:
//!
//! - **The pane itself.** Paneflow presents as Ghostty
//!   (`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty`), so Claude Code already writes OSC 9;4 progress
//!   and OSC 777 notifications into the grid, and libghostty already decodes
//!   both. They were feeding a tab chip and a desktop notification and stopping
//!   there.
//! - **Claude Code's own session registry**
//!   ([`crate::claude_session_registry`]), which reports the full turn state
//!   including *why* a session is blocked.
//!
//! Three writers on one map need an order, which is what
//! [`AgentStateSource`](crate::ai_types::AgentStateSource) is for; the rule
//! itself lives at the write choke point in `ipc_handler`. This module is the
//! entry point the non-hook sources go through, so they inherit the same
//! surface binding, the same attention sync and the same auto-clear as a hook
//! frame, rather than each growing its own copy.

/// registry-backed agent, or until the next signal otherwise - and the fix
/// would be to distrust the channel Paneflow is relying on precisely because
/// it survives a hook policy. Left as a documented edge rather than papered
/// over with heuristics about which program wrote the sequence.
