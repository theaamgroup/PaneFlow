//! The side dock's surface picker: what the dock shows the first time it is
//! opened, before the user has said what they want in it.
//!
//! The pane header's dock button used to drop straight into the git diff, which
//! made "open the side panel" and "review changes" the same gesture even when
//! the user wanted a shell or a file. The picker separates the two: opening the
//! dock asks, and the answer is remembered for the workspace that gave it, so
//! only that project's first open costs a click (Cursor / Codex both behave this
//! way). The dock is detached per workspace ([`crate::app::cli_diff_dock`]), so
//! the next project starts from the same question rather than inheriting an
//! answer given for another repository.
//!
//! Four surfaces, matching the tabs the dock can actually host
//! ([`super::model::DiffDockTab`]): Changes, Terminal, File, Agent setup. Nothing here opens
//! a surface itself - each card routes to the exact entry point the tab strip's
//! `+` menu uses, so the two doors into the dock cannot drift apart.
