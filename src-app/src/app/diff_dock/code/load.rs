//! Off-thread file loading for the editor, with the guardrails that decide
//! whether a file opens editable, opens read-only, or does not open at all.
//!
//! prd-file-editor-2026-Q3, US-002 (async load + generation guard) and US-003
//! (refusal rules).
//!
//! **Why off-thread.** `std::fs::read` on a cold 8 MB file is tens of
//! milliseconds of blocking syscall; run on the GPUI thread it is a visible
//! stall of the whole window, every pane included. The load therefore follows
//! the shape `markdown/view.rs::start_initial_load` already established here:
//! `cx.spawn` + `smol::unblock` for the blocking part, then a single
//! `WeakEntity::update` back on the main thread. A dead entity (tab closed
//! mid-read) makes that update fail silently, which is the intended outcome.
//!
//! **Why a generation guard.** Clicking three files quickly starts three reads
//! that can finish in any order; without a guard, the slowest read wins and the
//! tab shows a file the user is no longer on. [`CodeLoadSlot`] stamps every
//! request with a monotonically increasing generation and accepts a result only
//! when it still matches the latest one. It is a plain struct, deliberately
//! free of any GPUI type, so the ordering rule is unit-testable without a test
//! app; [`spawn_code_load`] is the thin GPUI wrapper over it.
