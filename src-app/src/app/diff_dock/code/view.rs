//! The entity that hosts a [`CodeElement`]: one open file, its scroll state,
//! its caret, and the mouse plumbing the element cannot own.
//!
//! `CodeElement` paints; everything that has to survive between frames lives
//! here. The split follows Zed's `Editor` / `EditorElement` pair and Paneflow's
//! own diff dock: state on the entity, geometry on the element, handed back
//! through a single `Rc<Cell<CodeGeometry>>` the element writes during
//! `prepaint` and the wheel / scrollbar handlers read.
//!
//! ## The two-axis scroll recipe
//!
//! Verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` ("GPUI scroll & wheel"), and load-bearing in all
//! three of its parts:
//!
//! - `overflow_y_scroll()` is what actually moves the element. GPUI only pushes
//!   the scroll offset onto the element-offset stack when the host's overflow
//!   axis is `Scroll`; under `overflow_hidden` a custom element that positions
//!   content off its own `bounds.origin` never moves at all.
//! - `track_scroll()` keeps `offset()` / `bounds()` / `max_offset()` live, which
//!   is where the vertical scrollbar's geometry comes from.
//! - `restrict_scroll_to_axis = Some(true)` stops the native Y handler
//!   back-filling `delta_y` from `delta.x`. Without it, a Shift+wheel gesture
//!   scrolls the file vertically instead of horizontally.
//!
//! Horizontal is fully custom and always reads `delta.x`. X11, Wayland and
//! Windows all swap Shift+wheel onto the X axis at the platform layer and zero
//! `delta.y`, and macOS delivers horizontal natively, so branching on
//! `modifiers.shift` would read a zero on every platform.
//!
//! ## Caret and selection (EP-003)
//!
//! The caret is a byte offset carried by a [`CodeSelection`], the same shape
//! `widgets/text_area.rs:441` uses. Every "where does it land" rule lives in
//! [`super::cursor`], which knows nothing about GPUI; this file only turns an
//! event into one call and one repaint. Hit-testing goes through the element's
//! [`CodeHitMap`], i.e. the real `ShapedLine`s of the frame that was painted,
//! so a click lands on a glyph boundary even with tabs or wide characters.
//!
//! ## Editing (EP-004)
//!
//! Every mutation of the rope goes through [`CodeView::splice_all`], including
//! the platform's own text input. That single door is what makes the read-only
//! refusal, the undo history and the dirty mark impossible to bypass: an action
//! handler that spliced directly would silently skip all three.
//!
//! Three decisions are deliberate and worth stating rather than rediscovering:
//!
//! - **The IME composition lives in the document.** US-012 asks that the
//!   document be "mutated only on commit", but GPUI's `EntityInputHandler`
//!   protocol reads the marked text back out of the buffer
//!   (`text_for_range`, `bounds_for_range`), so a preedit held on the side
//!   would render nothing and place the candidate window nowhere. The preedit
//!   is spliced in as a single typing transaction, tracked in `marked`, and
//!   painted underlined so it reads as uncommitted - the same shape as Zed's
//!   `Editor` and `widgets/text_area.rs`. A commit replaces it in place; an
//!   abandoned composition is removed, never left pending.
//! - **This view owns its own conflict watcher.** `diff/view/watcher.rs`
//!   watches a worktree, on another entity, only while the diff is open. What
//!   is reused is its shape (parent directory, non-recursive, debounced), not
//!   its instance.
//! - **Disk work runs on GPUI's background executor**, not `smol::unblock`.
//!   Both keep the render thread free; only the former is driven by the test
//!   scheduler, which is what lets `Ctrl+S` and the conflict refusal be proven
//!   from the action rather than from `super::save` alone.
