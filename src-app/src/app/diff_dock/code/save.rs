//! Writing a file back to disk, and the stamp that tells the editor whether
//! someone else got there first.
//!
//! prd-file-editor-2026-Q3, US-015 and US-016. Everything here is blocking:
//! [`super::view::CodeView`] runs it on GPUI's background executor
//! (`cx.background_spawn`), which keeps it off the render thread exactly as
//! `smol::unblock` does for the read side, and additionally puts it under the
//! test scheduler so the save and conflict paths can be proven from the
//! `Ctrl+S` action rather than from this function alone.
//!
//! ## Why a temp file plus a rename
//!
//! `File::create` truncates before it writes. A crash, a full disk, or an
//! agent reading the file mid-write then sees a truncated or half-written
//! source file - the failure mode US-015 exists to prevent. Writing a sibling
//! temp file and renaming it over the target makes the swap atomic on all
//! three platforms, so a reader sees either the old file or the new one.
//!
//! The temp file must live in the **target's own directory**, never in
//! `$TMPDIR`: a cross-filesystem rename is neither atomic nor always
//! permitted. Same reasoning, same shape as `crate::config_writer`
//! (`config_writer.rs:75-118`) and Zed's `Fs::atomic_write`
//! (`zed/crates/fs/src/fs.rs:927-935`).
//!
//! ## Why the rename is also what US-016 watches
//!
//! The rename lands as a create or rename event on the parent directory, not
//! as a modify on the file's inode. That is why the conflict watcher in
//! `super::view` watches the parent directory rather than the file, and why
//! the diff dock's own worktree watcher (`diff/view/watcher.rs:38-46`, which
//! accepts anything that is not a metadata or access event) picks a save up
//! and refreshes the diff without any extra wiring.
