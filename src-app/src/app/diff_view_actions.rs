//! EP-001 (prd-git-diff-mode-2026-Q3.md): lifecycle + main-area entry
//! point for the dedicated Git Diff mode ([`AppMode::Diff`]).
//!
//! The mode owns the full main area plus its own left sidebar, entered
//! via the CLI / Review tabs in the shared sidebar footer. EP-001 stands up the shell
//! only - `enter_diff_mode` just flips the mode and `render_diff_main`
