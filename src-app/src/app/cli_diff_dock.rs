//! Right-docked git diff for the CLI cockpit.
//!
//! The trailing `layout-sidebar-right` button of a pane header toggles the side
//! dock ([`crate::app::diff_dock`]) on that pane's *workspace folder*. The
//! dock hosts three surfaces - the working-tree diff against `HEAD`, a shell,
//! and open files - and asks which one the first time a workspace opens it
//! (`diff_dock::surface_picker`). This module owns the CLI plumbing only - the
//! toggle, the per-workspace attachment, and the dock host; the panel itself is
//! rendered once by [`crate::app::diff_dock`].
//!
//! The dock is *detached per workspace*: it belongs to the folder it was opened
//! on, so switching workspace parks it and brings up whatever the incoming
//! workspace last had - nothing at all, until that workspace opens the dock
//! itself and answers the picker.
