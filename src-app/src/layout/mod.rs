//! N-ary tree layout for terminal panes.
//!
//! Leaf nodes hold terminal pane entities. Container nodes hold 2+ children
//! with a direction (horizontal/vertical) and per-child flex ratios.
//!
//! Module layout (US-029 of the src-app refactor PRD):
//! - [`tree`] - core types, constants, ratio helpers, `new_split`
//! - [`mutations`] - `split_at_*` and `swap_panes`
//! - [`close`] - `close_focused` and `remove_pane` (kept separate from
//!   `mutations` for the 280 LOC cap)
//! - [`queries`] - read-only traversal + `equalize_ratios`
//! - [`render`] - GPUI flex rendering with drag-to-resize
//! - [`presets`] - `from_panes_equal`, `main_vertical`, `tiled`
//! - [`navigation`] - `FocusDirection`, `FocusNav`, focus movement
//! - [`serde`] - `serialize` / `from_layout_node`
