//! AI tool type definitions shared across the app.
//!
//! The tool identity is [`crate::agent_launcher::TerminalAgent`] - the same
//! 16-agent taxonomy as the terminal launchers (single source of truth:
//! binaries are the wire ids, `display_name`/`accent`/`display_rank` come
//! for free). The historical 2-variant `AiTool` enum was folded into it
//! when hook support grew past Claude Code + Codex; on the wire, `tool` is
//! the agent's binary name (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, …) resolved via
//! [`TerminalAgent::from_binary`], and an UNKNOWN string is now rejected
//! instead of silently retyped as Claude.
//!
//! `AgentState` tracks the lifecycle state of a single agent session.
//! `AgentSession` bundles tool + state + the currently-active sub-tool name
//! (`Edit`, `Bash`, …) for one PID. A workspace can hold many sessions
//! concurrently - keyed by PID in `Workspace::agent_sessions`.
//!
//! State transitions are driven by IPC hooks from the `paneflow-ai-hook`
//! binary. Each lifecycle frame carries the emitting process's PID so the
//! server can route updates to the exact session rather than collapsing
//! everything per tool name (which broke when two Claude Codes ran in the
//! same workspace - the second `ai.session_start` used to overwrite the
//! first PID in a `HashMap<String, u32>`).
