//! `paneflow <verb>` scriptable CLI (EP-001, prd-cli-agent-orchestration).
//!
//! Talks to a RUNNING Paneflow instance over the existing IPC JSON-RPC socket
//! (`paneflow-ipc-client`) and exits before any GPUI init. `main.rs` dispatches
//! here only when `argv[1]` names a known verb ([`is_cli_verb`]) - mirroring the
//! `paneflow mcp …` intercept - so every other invocation (no args, unknown
//! args, `--help`/`--version`) is left untouched and the GUI
//! launch path is preserved. clap therefore never has to own the "no subcommand
//! => launch the GUI" default, and never eats the manually-parsed top-level
//! flags handled above it.
