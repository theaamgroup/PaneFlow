//! Every `svg()` icon must set its own `text_color`.
//!
//! GPUI's `svg()` rasterizes to a monochrome alpha mask painted in the colour
//! taken from that element's *own* style. It does not inherit the parent's
//! text colour the way a text glyph does, so an `svg()` with no `text_color`
//! of its own paints nothing at all.
//!
//! That failure is invisible to every other kind of test, and nearly invisible
//! in review: the button still lays out, still hit-tests, still shows its
//! tooltip and still runs its click handler. Only the glyph is missing, which
//! is exactly how the sidebar's delete icon and the text fields' clear icon
//! both shipped as blank squares - a button users could not see but could
//! still press.
//!
//! Enforcing it here rather than by convention keeps the whole class from
//! coming back, since nothing else in the suite can observe a painted pixel.
