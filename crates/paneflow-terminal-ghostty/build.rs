//! spelling of "the native Ghostty FFI layer is linked into this build". The
//! crate used to repeat a platform-and-feature predicate at every gate site;
//! the alias collapses those to one condition and makes adding a target a
//! change to [`ghostty_native_target`] rather than a textual sweep.
//!
//! It declares no build-dependencies and performs no filesystem or network
//! I/O, so it costs one process spawn and cannot fail.

    // rerun fingerprint.
