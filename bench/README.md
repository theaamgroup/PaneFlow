# Terminal performance benchmark

`bench/` holds the reproducible measurements behind PaneFlow's terminal
performance claims. Every number published about the terminal pipeline comes
from this suite, run with the script below, and the raw result of each run is
archived next to the baseline it is compared against.

## What is measured

The benchmark is the ignored test `terminal_pipeline_benchmark` in
`src-app/src/terminal/perf_bench.rs`. It exercises the terminal pipeline
without a GPU or a window: the libghostty parser and snapshot, the conversion
into the renderer's neutral `Content`, the window-free layout pass, the
per-frame lookups the render thread performs, and the runtime loop's idle
behavior. Timings are wall-clock medians; allocations are counted by the test
binary's recording allocator (`src-app/src/terminal/test_allocator.rs`), a
wrapper around the system allocator installed for the test binary only.

| Metric | Unit | What it captures |
|---|---|---|
| `idle_wakeups_display_per_s` | wakeups/s | Runtime loop iterations of a display-only session with nothing to do. Direct CPU cost of an idle pane. |
| `idle_wakeups_shell_per_s` | wakeups/s | Same for a live shell sitting at its prompt. Skipped when the host cannot spawn a shell. |
| `publish_scroll_220x60` | ns | One scrolled line of styled output, then snapshot plus conversion to `Content`, on a 220x60 grid where every row is dirty. |
| `publish_echo_220x60` | ns | One keystroke echo on the bottom row, then snapshot plus conversion. Only one row changed. |
| `publish_scroll_120x40` | ns | The scroll case on a 120x40 grid, the size of a typical split pane. |
| `layout_220x60` | ns | The layout pass over a full 220x60 snapshot: run batching, background rectangles, contrast checks. |
| `line_text_at_220x60` | ns | Text of one hovered row extracted from the published snapshot, the input of link detection. |
| `base_font_resolve` | ns | The base font resolution the renderer performs for every pane on every frame. |
| `active_theme_read` | ns | The theme read the layout pass performs for every pane on every frame. |
| `gate_trickle_publishes` | frames per 1000 chunks | Frames the publish gate lets through when grid changes arrive every 2 ms with the queue drained. Bounds redraw frequency on trickle output such as a build log or an agent transcript. |
| `pipeline_corpus_mib_s` | MiB/s | Parse plus snapshot plus conversion throughput over the deterministic corpus, one publish per stream. |

Every timing metric also reports p95, mean, bytes allocated per iteration, and
allocation calls per iteration. `gate_trickle_publishes` and the two idle
probes are counts, not timings. Lower is better everywhere except
`pipeline_corpus_mib_s`.

The corpus is `deterministic_streams()` in
`src-app/src/terminal/bench_corpus.rs`, seeded with `CORPUS_SEED`, so every
run parses byte-identical input.

The metric names, units, and result schema are upstream's, so a result from
this fork compares against an upstream document with the same table code.
What some of them measure on this tree differs until the terminal
performance work lands: there is no publish gate yet (#343), so
`gate_trickle_publishes` reads the chunk count (1000), the `publish_*` and
`pipeline_corpus_mib_s` metrics pay for a full snapshot-to-`Content`
conversion per frame, and both idle probes count a fixed 10 ms runtime tick.
Those are the metrics the gate and the idle-loop work are expected to move;
`layout_220x60` is the one the layout memo (#344) targets. The baseline is
the run before that work, so later runs show the cumulative change.

## Running

```bash
scripts/bench-terminal.sh
```

The script builds the `paneflow` test binary under the release profile,
records the short commit SHA, whether the worktree is dirty, and a UTC stamp,
then writes `bench/results/<stamp>-<sha>.json`. When `bench/baseline.json`
exists, the run also prints a Markdown comparison table between the
`PANEFLOW_BENCH_TABLE_BEGIN` and `PANEFLOW_BENCH_TABLE_END` markers. That table
is the artifact to share. Without a baseline the run still succeeds and only
prints the metrics and the result path.

`scripts/bench-terminal.sh --set-baseline` copies the fresh result to
`bench/baseline.json`. The committed baseline is measured on the Apple Silicon
development machine at the commit before the September 2026 terminal
performance work (#343, #344), with nothing else running; its `git_sha` and
`cpu` fields say which commit and machine.

The test refuses to run under the debug profile, which would measure the
compiler rather than the code. Set `PANEFLOW_BENCH_ALLOW_DEBUG=1` to override
while developing the suite itself. `PANEFLOW_BENCH_SKIP_IDLE=1` skips the two
idle probes, which spend several seconds waiting for a shell to settle; the
timed scenarios run first either way, so the probes never disturb them.

## Fairness rules

A comparison is only meaningful between runs on the same machine, at the same
grid sizes, with the same corpus seed, and both built under the release
profile. The result document records OS, architecture, CPU model, profile,
seed, and commit so that a mismatched comparison is visible. Close heavy
applications before a run; the medians are robust to a stray interruption,
the p95 values are not.

Two runs of the same commit differ by a few percent on the microsecond
metrics. Treat a change below 5% as noise unless the allocation columns, which
are deterministic, moved with it.

The run measures its own CPU share over the timed scenarios (process CPU time
divided by wall time, recorded as `cpu_share` in the result). The scenarios
are single-threaded and never sleep, so an uncontended run reports close to
1.0. Process CPU time comes from libproc, whose figures are Mach ticks and are
converted through `mach_timebase_info`. A run that prints
`PANEFLOW_BENCH_WARNING` got less than 90% of a core: something else was
competing (a `cargo build` in another worktree is enough), its timings are
inflated, and it should not be published as a comparison.

## Reading the table

`Change` is the relative move of the headline value and, in parentheses, the
speedup: baseline over now for costs, now over baseline for throughput. A
timing that halved reads `-50.0% (2.00x)`. `Alloc/iter` columns show bytes
allocated per iteration and are exact.
